<button class="collapsible">Understanding Pol II transcriptional regulation upon HSV-1 infection</button>
<div class="content">
<p align="justify">RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) is the enzyme responsible for transcribing DNA into protein-encoding mRNAs in mammals. Upon Herpes Simplex Virus-1 infection (HSV-1), there is massive transcriptional repression of the host genome. Our lab discovered that this loss of mRNA levels upon infection is due to the reduction of Pol II on the host genome during HSV-1 infection. I, and others, have shown that the immediate early viral protein called ICP4 is a master regulator of Pol II occupancy on the host genome during infection.<br>

I have performed Pol II ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing) in mock infected cells, WT HSV-1 infected cells, and n12 infected cells. n12 is a mutant HSV-1 strain that codes for a truncated, non-functional ICP4. Pol II ChIP-seq experiments comparing infection of HEK 293 cells with wildtype or a mutant HSV-1 virus lacking the viral protein ICP4 shows a near-complete recovery of Pol II occupancy upon the deletion of ICP4. Furthermore, the deletion of ICP4 changes the set of genes that are activated upon infection. ChIP-seq experiments have also revealed that ICP4 activates genes by changing Pol II pausing. Current experiments are teasing out how ICP4 promoters Pol II pause release.<br>

I have also looked at the effect of the exogenous expression of ICP4 in HEK 293 cells in the absence of infection. I first performed luciferase assays with various promoter compositions. ICP4 was able to activate luciferase expression from each reporter plasmid. I repeated this experiment with an episomally associated luciferase reporter plasmid. The chromatinization of the luciferase plasmid was enough to completly block ICP4-mediated activation of luciferase expression.<br>

Finally, I looked at the effect of ICP4 expression on the host genome in the absence of infection. I transfected HEK 293 cells with an mCherry-tagged ICP4 construct and sorted cells, collecting only those that were mChery positive. I extracted total RNA and performed qRT-PCR and compared to mRNA levels from cells expressing mCherry alone. ICP4 was unable to repress transcription of genes identified as repressed from my ChIP-seq analysis. ICP4 was able to activate some, but not all, genes identified as activated by ChIP-seq analysis. Altogether, these results suggest that ICP4 can activate genes in a mechanism that is sensitive to the chromatin state of the gene. ICP4, however, is not sufficient to repress transcription in the absence of infection. This suggests that repression might require a "Pol II sink" that only exists during productive lytic infection.</p>
